# By default listen on https://localhost
# To change this:
# * uncomment SEARXNG_HOSTNAME, and replace <host> by the SearXNG hostname
# * uncomment LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL, and replace <email> by your email (require to create a Let's Encrypt certificate)

# SEARXNG_HOSTNAME=<host>
# LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=<email>

# Optional:
# If you run a very small or a very large instance, you might want to change the amount of used uwsgi workers and threads per worker
# More workers (= processes) means that more search requests can be handled at the same time, but it also causes more resource usage

# SEARXNG_UWSGI_WORKERS=4
# SEARXNG_UWSGI_THREADS=4
